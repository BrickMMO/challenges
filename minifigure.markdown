**Please reach out to me before using this activity!! We have limited minfig parts.**

> **Note**  
> These instructions assume you are running this challenge at the [Humber Polytechnic](https://humber.ca/) campus in room CTI306. If you are not, there are instructions at the bottom of this page on creating your own copies of this puzzle.

1. There is a bin of minifigure parts organized into legs, torsos, hands, hair, hats, pets, and accessories. Lay the different parts out on a table and give participants thirty minutes to create their minifigure. Participants will usually use the whole thirty minutes, and often request additional time. 

2. Instruct participants to try to limit the other participants from seeing their minifigure. 
    
3. Place the completed minifigures on a table. Possibly use a webcam to display each one on the classroom screens. Challenge participants to identfiy who each minifigure is or rate which minifgure is most accurate. 

## Preparing your Own Minifig Me Activity

Minifigure parts can be hard to come by. If you're looking to aquire your own collection of minfigure parts [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/) or [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace) might be your best option. You could also purchase individual parts from the [LEGO&reg; Pick a Brick](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/pick-and-build/pick-a-brick) or [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com/).
