> **Note**  
> These instructions assume you are running this challenge at the [Humber Polytechnic](https://humber.ca/) campus in room CTI306. If you are not, there are instructions at the bottom of this page on preparing your own challenges.

1. There are four copies of the LEGO&reg; Build Teogether sets. This set contains 24 small builds.

2. Divide the class into pairs. Each round half the pairs will be building and half of the pairs will observing the bulders to make sure no one is cheating!

3. Choose a set. Start with small sets. If the building is going well, increase the size of the set each round. 

    If you have more than eight pairs (four bulders and four obsevers), use sets of similar size and from different bags. For example the red helicopter from bag one is about the same size as the blue space shuttle from bag seven.

4. Each pair chooses a builder and a caller. Give the caller the instructions. Give the builder the bag of LEGO&reg; bricks.

    If there are not enough instructions, they are also available online:

    | Colour | Bags | Link |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Red Instructions | Bags 1-3 | [Download Instruction](https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.core.pdf/6414836.pdf) |
    | Green Instructions | Bags 4-6 | [Download Instruction](https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.core.pdf/6414839.pdf) |
    | Blue Instructions | Bags 7-9 | [Download Instruction](https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.core.pdf/6414842.pdf) |
    | Yellow Instructions | Bags 10-12 | [Download Instruction](https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.core.pdf/6414845.pdf) |

5. Callers can describe the instructions, point, use hand gestuers, and see the bricks the builder is building. Everything but touch the bricks. Builders can build, ask questions, and show the caller the build. Everything but see the instructions. 

    > **Note**
    > For an exciting last round, you can place a barrier between the builder and caller. This way the caller cannot see the bricks and progress the builder is making. There is a large pad paper in the closet (CTI304, must be opened from the hallway) that can be used to create barriers. 

6. The first half of the teams to complete the build perfectly move on to the next round. For larger builds or blind builds you can set a round time limit and then have the observers vote on who they think won the round. 

    > **Note**
    > The first round can be a practice round. No elimination after round one. 

7. After each non-practice round, elimiate half the teams, and increase the complexity of the build. Here is a sample bracket for 16 participants (eight groups):
