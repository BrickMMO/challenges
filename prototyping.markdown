## Prototyping

In this activity, groups will be challenged to prototype an objective using a LEGO&reg; kit. In the past this activity has been used to prototype a bipharma manufacturing facility, an innovative learning space, and the library of the future.

1. Each group will choose a LEGO&reg; theme. There are kits set aside from LEGO&reg; Classic, LEGO&reg; Batman&trade;, LEGO&reg; Harry Potter&trade;, and LEGO&reg; Star Wars&trade;.

   There is also a LEGO&reg; MOC (My Own Creation) that can be used to assign groups to a theme. Place the four boxes on a desk at the front, each box has a bin of matching LEGO&reg;, and allow one member from each group to come up to the front and reveal a minifigure.

2. Discuss the bulding objectives and any related factors to consider. You may want to include your own brainstorming process and slidedeck during this step.

3. Give participants two to four hours to build their prototype. In past sessions sometimes two hours has been too much time and participants are board, and sometimes four hours has been too little.

4. Allow each group to have five minutes to present their idea.

   I have often setup a camera so groups can easily display their prototype on the projection screen.

## Cleanup

Please deconstruct the LEGO&reg; prototypes and place LEGO&reg; back in their bin. Please keep LEGO&reg; seperated by their theme. Place bins, boxes, and the reveal MOC back in the CTI304 closet.
