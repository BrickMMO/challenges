1. There are seven copies of this puzzle in the plastic drawers in room CTI306. Sort the blocks based on their colour. There should be six 2 x 2 x 1 blocks and three 1 x 1 x 1 blocks. The two coloured patters on the blocks are not part of the puzzle.

2. Put students into groups (max seven groups). Give each group a puzzle. Instruct groups to use the blocks to build a perfect cube. 

3. **Hint!** If groups are struggling, encourgae them to calculate the overall size of the cube. The overall size of the cube will be 3 x 3 x 3 (like a Rubiks Cube).
